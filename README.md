# To-Do-List
Generates a nifty webpage where you can see chores I need to do as well as concerts coming up and a bunch of other stuff (runs on Google Sheets API).

The actual list data lives in a Google sheet and is called in through an API call I documented thoroughly in the file "custom.js" within the repo.
